# Website Glutton

### Official Website / Project site: https://maingron.com/website_glutton

The Website Glutton is a little Proof of Concept I made for my boss at work. A customer wanted a little gimmick for his website. Yet it wasn't developed further and so it's just a Proof of Concept. `You shouldn't implement this onto a website!`

To implement it onto a website, just go to the end of your HTML and paste this:
```html
<script src="/website_glutton/website_glutton.js" async> </script>
```
