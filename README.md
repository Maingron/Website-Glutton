# Website Glutton

### Official Website / Project site: https://maingron.com/website_glutton

The Website Glutton is a little Proof of Concept I made for my boss at work back in 2019, I think. A customer wanted a little gimmick for his website. Yet it wasn't developed further and so it's just a Proof of Concept.

The idea behind this is that the glutton follows the user's cursor and eats the website away.
